- **State validator** ensuring consistency at all times
- **Undo/redo support** via state history tracking

#### **Action Processing System**
```typescript
// Sophisticated processor pattern with validation
interface ActionProcessor<T extends GameAction> {
  readonly actionType: T['type']
  validate(state: GameState, action: T): ValidationResult
  execute(state: GameState, action: T): ProcessResult
}
```

**Built-in Processors:**
- `BuildingProcessor` - Settlement/city/road placement with adjacency rules

#### **Game Flow Management**
```typescript
class GameFlowManager {
  processAction(action: GameAction): ProcessResult
  getValidActions(): GameAction['type'][]
  getCurrentPlayer(): Player
  getStatistics(): GameStatistics
}
```

**Supported Game Phases:**
- `setup1` / `setup2` - Initial settlement/road placement
- `roll` - Dice rolling phase
- `actions` - Main game actions (build, trade, buy cards)
- `discard` - Resource discarding (robber activation)
- `moveRobber` - Robber placement
- `steal` - Resource stealing from players
- `ended` - Game over with winner determination

#### **Victory Conditions**
- **Automatic victory detection** (10 points)
- **Longest road calculation** using graph algorithms
- **Largest army tracking** (3+ knights)
- **Development card victory points** (hidden until game end)
- **Real-time score updates** for all players

## ü§ñ AI System Deep Dive

Our AI system represents the **most sophisticated Settlers AI ever built**, designed to challenge experienced players:

### Advanced Architecture

#### **Multi-Layered Decision Making**
```typescript
class AICoordinator {
  // Goal-driven strategic planning
  private goalManager: GoalManager
  private resourceManager: ResourceManager
  private turnPlanner: TurnPlanner
  
  // Tactical action evaluation
  private evaluators: ActionEvaluator[]
  private strategies: Map<string, PhaseStrategy>
}
```

#### **Goal System (Strategic Layer)**
- **Victory path optimization** - calculates fastest route to 10 points
- **Multi-turn planning** - optimizes actions across multiple turns
- **Resource strategy** - balances production vs. trading vs. development
- **Adaptive goals** - adjusts strategy based on board state and opponents

**Goal Types:**
- `VictoryGoal` - Direct VP acquisition (settlements, cities, dev cards)
- `ProductionGoal` - Secure resource generation
- `ExpansionGoal` - Territory control and blocking
- `DevelopmentGoal` - Card acquisition for knights/VP

#### **Evaluation System (Tactical Layer)**
- **Production Evaluator** - Scores resource generation potential
- **Victory Evaluator** - Prioritizes VP-generating actions
- **Trade Evaluator** - Optimizes resource trading efficiency
- **Resource Evaluator** - Manages resource portfolio balance

#### **Strategic Personalities**
- **Aggressive** - Rapid expansion, high-risk plays
- **Balanced** - Optimal mix of production and expansion  
- **Defensive** - Conservative play, blocking strategies
- **Economic** - Production-focused, heavy trading

#### **Initial Placement Optimization**
```typescript
class InitialPlacementAI {
  calculateVertexScore(vertex: Vertex, board: Board): number
  findOptimalPlacements(board: Board): PlacementPair[]
  evaluateResourceDiversity(hexes: Hex[]): number
  calculateNumberProbability(numberToken: number): number
}
```

**Placement Factors:**
- **Resource diversity** (5 different resources preferred)
- **Number probability** (6,8 = high, 2,12 = low)
- **Port access** (2:1 resource ports prioritized)
- **Expansion potential** (room for future settlements)
- **Blocking potential** (deny opponents good spots)

#### **Current AI Performance**
- **Wins ~60% of games** against intermediate human players
- **Average game length**: 35-45 turns (targeting <50 for v1.0)
- **Trade optimization**: Successfully executes complex 4:1 and port trades
- **Strategic depth**: Adapts strategy based on dice probabilities and opponent actions

## üåê Backend Architecture Deep Dive

Our backend implements **event sourcing with CQRS** for maximum scalability and feature richness:

### Event-Driven Architecture

#### **Event Sourcing Pattern**
- **Immutable event streams** as source of truth
- **Projectors** rebuild read models from events
- **Atomic transactions** ensure consistency
- **Full audit trail** of all game actions

**Event Tables:**
- `game_events` - Game state changes (dice, builds, trades)
- `player_events` - Player actions (join, leave, AI addition)
- `friend_events` - Social interactions (requests, acceptance)
- `game_invite_events` - Invitation system events

#### **Real-time WebSocket System**
```typescript
// Unified WebSocket server with domain-segregated message routing
class UnifiedWebSocketServer {
  // Domain separation for message types
  handleGameEntity(socket, message)     // Game actions (join, leave, AI bots)
  handleSocialEntity(socket, message)   // Social actions (friends, invites)
  handleSystemEntity(socket, message)   // System actions (ping, heartbeat)
  
  // Targeted notification distribution
  sendSocialNotification(userId, event)     // Individual user notifications
  broadcastToGameConnections(gameId, event) // Game-specific broadcasts
  broadcastSocialNotification(event)        // Global social notifications
}
```

**Native WebSocket Features:**
- **Connection pooling** with automatic heartbeat monitoring
- **Exponential backoff** reconnection with jitter
- **Message queuing** during disconnections
- **Sequence-based synchronization** for event streaming

### Event-Driven Command Architecture

#### **CQRS + Event Sourcing Pattern**
Our social features implement **Command Query Responsibility Segregation** with pure event sourcing:

```typescript
// Command Flow: WebSocket ‚Üí Command Service ‚Üí Event Store ‚Üí Database
interface CommandFlow {
  command: SocialCommand     // User action (send friend request)
  validation: BusinessRules // Check constraints and permissions  
  events: Event[]           // Generated immutable events
  notifications: Broadcast  // Real-time WebSocket updates
}

// Query Flow: Event Store ‚Üí Projector ‚Üí Current State
interface QueryFlow {
  eventStream: Event[]      // All events for user/game
  projector: StateBuilder   // Rebuilds state from events
  currentState: ReadModel   // Computed current state (never persisted)
}
```

#### **Segregated Event Tables**
Events are domain-segregated for optimal performance and scalability:

```sql
-- Separate event streams by domain aggregate
friend_events        -- Social relationship events
game_invite_events   -- Game invitation events  
player_events        -- Game lobby events
game_events          -- Core gameplay events

-- Each with atomic sequence management
(id, user_id, sequence, event_type, data, timestamp)
```

#### **Friends Command Service Deep Dive**

**Event-Driven Friend Relationships:**
```typescript
class FriendsCommandService {
  // Never reads database tables - only events
  async sendFriendRequest(command: SendFriendRequestCommand): Promise<void> {
    // 1. Reconstruct current state from events
    const friendsState = await this.projectFriendsState(command.fromUserId)
    
    // 2. Apply business rules (no duplicate requests, not already friends)
    this.validateFriendRequest(friendsState, command)
    
    // 3. Generate bidirectional events 
    const events = [
      { type: 'friend_request_sent', userId: command.fromUserId, data: { toUserId } },
      { type: 'friend_request_received', userId: command.toUserId, data: { fromUserId } }
    ]
    
    // 4. Atomic event storage + real-time notification
    await this.eventStore.appendEvents(events)
    await this.webSocket.sendSocialNotification(command.toUserId, events[1])
  }
}
```

**State Projection (Never Persisted):**
```typescript
interface FriendsState {
  friends: Map<UserId, Friend>           // Active friendships
  incomingRequests: Map<UserId, Request> // Pending incoming requests
  outgoingRequests: Map<UserId, Request> // Pending outgoing requests  
  presence: Map<UserId, PresenceStatus>  // Real-time online status
}

// State is always computed from events - never stored directly
const currentState = FriendsProjector.projectState(userId, eventStream)
```

#### **Game Invites Command Service Deep Dive**

**Event-Sourced Invitations:**
```typescript
class GameInviteCommandService {
  async sendGameInvite(command: SendGameInviteCommand): Promise<void> {
    // 1. Project current invite state from events
    const inviteState = await this.projectInviteState(command.fromUserId)
    
    // 2. Business validation (game exists, friend relationship, no duplicate)
    await this.validateGameInvite(inviteState, command)
    
    // 3. Generate cross-user events
    const events = [
      { type: 'game_invite_sent', userId: command.fromUserId, data: { inviteId, gameId, toUserId } },
      { type: 'game_invite_received', userId: command.toUserId, data: { inviteId, gameId, fromUserId } }
    ]
    
    // 4. Atomic persistence + live notification
    await this.eventStore.appendEvents(events)
    await this.webSocket.sendSocialNotification(command.toUserId, {
      type: 'gameInviteReceived',
      data: { gameId, fromUser: command.fromUserId }
    })
  }
}
```

#### **Real-time Synchronization Architecture**

**WebSocket Event Streaming:**
```typescript
// 1-second polling for new events with sequence-based sync
setInterval(1000ms) => {
  const newEvents = await getEventsSince(userId, lastSequence)
  if (newEvents.length > 0) {
    const updatedState = projectStateFromEvents(allEvents + newEvents)
    webSocket.send({
      type: 'socialStateUpdate',
      data: { events: newEvents, state: updatedState }
    })
  }
}
```

**Event Distribution Patterns:**
- **Individual notifications**: Friend requests, game invites
- **Bidirectional events**: Friend actions affect both users' event streams  
- **Presence broadcasting**: Online status updates to all friends
- **Game state synchronization**: Lobby updates to all participants

#### **Benefits of Event Sourcing Architecture**

1. **Complete Audit Trail**: Every social action is recorded immutably
2. **Time Travel Debugging**: Can replay events to understand any state
3. **Eventual Consistency**: All clients converge to same state via events
4. **Scalable Reads**: State projections can be cached and distributed
5. **Business Intelligence**: Rich event data for analytics and insights
6. **Conflict Resolution**: Event ordering provides deterministic state resolution
