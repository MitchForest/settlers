export function getClient() {
  if (!client) {
    client = postgres(connectionString, {
      max: 10,
      idle_timeout: 20,
      connect_timeout: 10
    })
  }
  return client
}
```

## Technical Implementation Notes

### State Management Architecture
```typescript
// Zustand store structure
interface GameStore {
  // Core State
  gameState: GameState | null
  localPlayerId: PlayerId | null
  
  // UI State  
  placementMode: 'none' | 'settlement' | 'city' | 'road'
  validPlacements: { settlements: Set<string>, roads: Set<string>, cities: Set<string> }
  
  // WebSocket
  ws: WebSocket | null
  connectionStatus: 'connecting' | 'connected' | 'disconnected' | 'error'
  
  // Actions
  connect: (gameId: string, playerId: string) => Promise<void>
  sendAction: (action: GameAction) => void
  updateGameState: (state: GameState) => void
}
```

### Animation Strategy
- Use CSS transforms exclusively for 60fps performance
- GPU-accelerated properties only
- Framer Motion for complex sequences
- CSS animations for simple loops
- Intersection Observer for performance

### Component Architecture
```
GameBoard (Container)
├── HexGridLayer (react-hexgrid)
├── ConnectionLayer (React Flow)
└── InteractionLayer (Overlays)

PlayerDashboard (Fixed Bottom)
├── ResourceDisplay
├── DevelopmentCards  
└── ActionButtons

GameUI (Floating Elements)
├── DiceRoll
├── TradePanel
├── TurnTimer
└── VictorySequence
```

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load tutorial and non-critical assets
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Optimize re-renders with proper state structure
- Use Web Workers for heavy calculations
